\abstract{\addtocontents{toc}{\vspace{0.2em}}Every day, millions of people take photos and upload them to social media websites. Their goal is to share photos with people, but collectively they also create a vast repository of visual information.\\
\hspace*{1cm}When they engage with this visual information, in the form of social connection like\textit{ comments, likes, tags} etc. They also leave a semantic footprints about these visuals. This thesis finds methods to harness this semantic information to achieve better classification of this visual information. Improvement in classification accuracy leads to better organizing of data, better information retrieval, better recommendation.  \\
\hspace*{1cm}Large Scale Image Retrieval Benchmarks are generally consists of photos from web. These photos also have rich social meta data attached with them. Therefore, these photos augmented with their social networking data provides a good data-set for evaluating our methods. We have introduced a novel method of constructing features from social networking data and fuse them with automated concept searching methods like Latent Semantic Indexing to give valuable classification features. We compared the classification on these social features and image content based features using structured classification techniques. The findings suggested that social network meta data are very useful in image classification tasks and many times outperforms image content based methods. We further proposed the ensembling of these two different modalities of features to boost the classification results.}
